I'm a final year MSc student @ University of Salerno. My field of specializing is cloud computing ☁️ and concurrent programming 🧵.

Currently, I'm working 🔭 on my thesis 📕 about integrating graph handling to the [FLY multi-cloud DSL](http://github.com/bissim/FLY-language) by defining the [language API for graphs](https://github.com/bissim/FLY-graph).

Below you'll find a selection of repositories concerning projects I worked on during my studies.

I'm eager to learn 📚 about new technologies, particularly concerning cloud computing.
